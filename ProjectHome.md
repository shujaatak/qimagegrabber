The project goal is to provide a standard interface for various image grabbing sources like:

- Various properitary IP cameras stream formats (for e.g. [ICamview based cameras](http://icamview.com/))

- Standard mjpg streams (from [mjpg-streamer](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mjpg-streamer/) for e.g.)

- Image grabbing continously from a HTTP server

- [WebCAMXP](http://www.webcamxp.com/home.aspx) properitary MJPG stream

Sorry no released packages yet, use the svn source.
